# PyMuddy
This is a pure-python MUD engine/server

The only dependency is twisted and its sub-dependencies.

You don't need a MUD client to connect to it, KiTTY/PuTTY on Windows and the telnet command on Mac OSX and Linux should work.

This is a work in progress, but it's going to be a fully-finished game at some point.

It will be done when it is done.

Storage is in JSON, everything else is Python. Runs on 2.7 ONLY due to the use of Twisted reactors, etc.
